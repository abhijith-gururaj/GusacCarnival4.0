        <item>1. In our event the participants should make a device which isbalanced in air by using the concept of magnetic levitation. \n\n* 2. The device should be made in such a way that the magnetic levitation can be used to create a continuous rotatory motion to thefloating part.\n\n 3. The change in flux during the rotatory motion is used to produce voltage in a copper coil which serves as the judging criteria**. 4. We will check the voltage produced at the ends of the coil using a DMM (Digital Multi Meter).\n\n *The procedure to make a magnetic levitation device is given in the following link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0c0GL9ha0 \n\n** The voltage produced can be measured using a Digital Multi-meter.\n https://www.facebook.com/ncharan.sai/videos/o.426744474134669/425534517589202/?type=2&amp;theater</item>

        <item>Imagine a world where you can make anything you want, just by pressing a single key “PRINT”. Ever wondered the process involved to make a three-dimensional object?.\n\n

To burst this question mark in your head, GUSAC Carnival 2015 brings to you a workshop on 3D printing.\n\n

3D Printing is an Additive Manufacturing technique that creates a physical object from a virtual 3D CAD model by depositing successive layers of material. They work like the traditional inkjet printers, but instead of ink, a 3D printer deposits desired material to manufacture an object from its digital format..\n \n

What will you be learning from this workshop:\n\n

Learn about the materials, designing of CAD models, working of a 3D Printer.\n
General Principles:\n\n

Modeling\n
Printing\n
Finishing\n
Understand how to build and calibrate a 3D printer.\n
Understand the basics of G code generation.\n
The participants will get 3D printed models that they design.\n

This new upcoming technology is to make product visualization from design stage simpler. Here, participants will design, operate and print parts using 3D printers on their own.GUSAC Carnival 2015 comes with the best team to impart knowledgeabout 3D printing, on the 8th and 9th of October with a cost of 1100 INR per participant only.\n\n\n</item>
